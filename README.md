8-bit ALU Verilog Project

Project Overview

The 8-bit ALU is a digital design implemented in Verilog HDL. It performs 16 different arithmetic and logic operations using 8-bit input operands A and B. This project demonstrates combinational logic design, case-based selection of operations, and simulation using a testbench.

Key Features

The ALU supports 16 operations: addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOR, NAND, XNOR, logical shift left/right, rotate left/right, and greater-than/equality comparisons. It is designed in Verilog HDL for easy integration into larger VLSI designs and includes a testbench for functional verification. Simulation results can be viewed in EDA Playground or local tools like Icarus Verilog + GTKWave.

Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience with digital logic design and verification, exposure to Verilog coding styles and testbench architecture, and the ability to explain step-by-step ALU operations clearly.
