8-bit ALU PROJECT USING VERILOG

Project Overview

The 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is implemented in Verilog HDL. It performs 16 different arithmetic and logic operations on 8-bit input operands A and B. This project demonstrates combinational logic design, case-based operation selection, and functional verification using a testbench.


Key Features

The ALU supports the following operations:

Arithmetic: Addition, Subtraction.
Logic: AND, OR, XOR, NOR, NAND, XNOR.
Shift: Logical Shift Left, Logical Shift Right.
Rotate: Rotate Left, Rotate Right.
Comparison: Greater-Than, Equality.
Additional features:
Designed in Verilog HDL for easy integration into larger VLSI designs.
Includes a testbench for functional verification.
Simulation results can be viewed on EDA Playground.


Learning Outcomes

Hands-on experience with digital logic design and verification.
Exposure to Verilog coding styles and testbench architecture.
Ability to explain ALU operations step-by-step.
